# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Go proxy server that translates OpenAI-compatible chat completions requests to Anthropic's Messages API format. It intercepts requests meant for OpenAI's API and forwards them to Claude's API with appropriate transformations.

The server uses zerolog for structured JSON logging with zero allocations and high performance.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the binary (automatically formats code first)
just build

# Run the server locally
just run

# Run tests
just test

# Install to GOPATH/bin
just install

# Build and push Docker image
just docker-build
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Format Go code (basic formatting)
just fmt

# Format Go code with goimports (organizes imports and formats)
just format

# Clean build artifacts
just clean
```

## Architecture

### Package Structure

The codebase follows Go conventions with internal packages:
- `cmd/claude-code-proxy/`: Entry point - minimal main function that starts the server
- `internal/server/`: Core server implementation
  - `server.go`: HTTP server setup, routing, and request handling
  - `types.go`: Data structures and JSON marshaling logic
  - `transform.go`: Message and system prompt transformation functions
  - `transform_test.go`: Unit tests for transformation logic
  - `prompts.go`: Claude Code system prompts and identity messages

### Core Components

- **Server Package** (`internal/server/`): Handles all server logic
  - HTTP server with structured logging middleware using zerolog
  - `/v1/messages` endpoint processes chat completion requests
  - `/health` endpoint for health checks (returns `{"status": "ok"}`)
  - Transforms OpenAI format to Anthropic format
  - Adds Claude Code specific system prompts
  - Manages cache control and ephemeral message limits

### API Endpoints

The proxy provides two primary modes of operation via distinct endpoints:

1.  **`/v1/responses` (Native Proxy)**
    - This is the primary endpoint for new integrations.
    - It accepts requests in the OpenAI Chat Completions format and forwards them to the upstream `/v1/responses` endpoint after applying necessary transformations.

2.  **`/v1/completions` (Legacy Compatibility)**
    - This endpoint provides backward compatibility for clients that still use the legacy `/v1/completions` API.
    - It accepts a legacy request, internally rewrites it into the modern `/v1/responses` format, and then forwards it upstream. This allows older clients to benefit from the new backend without modification.

### Key Transformations

1. **System Prompt Transformation** (`transformSystemPrompt`):

   - Prepends Claude Code identity messages
   - Replaces competitor names with "Claude Code"
   - Manages ephemeral cache control (max 4 messages)

2. **Message Processing** (`transformMessages`):

   - Replaces competitor names in message content
   - Manages ephemeral cache control limits

3. **Request Modifications**:
   - Sets max_tokens to 32000
   - Forces streaming mode
   - Adds user metadata
   - Configures Anthropic-specific headers

### Environment Requirements

The server requires these environment variables:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Anthropic's service
- `CLAUDE_USER_ID`: User ID for metadata tracking

Use the `update-env.sh` fish script to pull credentials from macOS Keychain and store them in chainenv.

### Docker Deployment

The service includes a multi-stage Dockerfile for containerized deployment:

- Builds with Go 1.23.4
- Runs as non-root user (appuser)
- Exposes port 8080
- Includes GitHub Container Registry push configuration

After each code change or task, always run:

```
just build
```

This automatically formats the code with goimports and then builds the Go server, ensuring proper import organization and catching any compile-time errors early. Do not skip this step after any modification.

## Logging

The server uses [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for structured logging:

### Configuration

- UNIX timestamp format for performance (`zerolog.TimeFormatUnix`)
- JSON output to stderr for structured log parsing
- Each server instance maintains its own logger with timestamps

### Log Levels

- `Info`: Request/response lifecycle, server startup
- `Warn`: Unhandled routes, non-critical issues
- `Error`: Request processing errors, API communication failures  
- `Debug`: Detailed request dumps and transformation data (when enabled)
- `Fatal`: Critical startup failures (missing environment variables)

### Structured Fields

Common fields used throughout the application:
- `method`: HTTP method
- `uri`: Request URI
- `remote_addr`: Client IP address
- `user_agent`: Client user agent
- `duration`: Request processing time
- `error`: Error details using `.Err(err)`

### Example Log Output

```json
{"level":"info","time":1516134303,"method":"POST","uri":"/v1/messages","remote_addr":"127.0.0.1:54321","user_agent":"curl/7.68.0","message":"Incoming request"}
{"level":"info","time":1516134304,"method":"POST","uri":"/v1/messages","duration":1023,"message":"Finished request"}
```

## Code Organization Principles

When adding new functionality:
1. Keep the main function minimal - it should only initialize and start the server
2. Use internal packages for implementation details that shouldn't be imported by external packages
3. Separate concerns: types in `types.go`, transformations in `transform.go`, handlers in `server.go`
4. Add new endpoints by updating `setupRoutes()` in `server.go`

## Go Conventions

- Follow Go naming conventions for all code
- Put tests in `*_test.go` files alongside the code they test, not in separate files

## Cloudflare Workers Support

This server supports deployment to Cloudflare Workers using the github.com/syumai/workers package. The Workers build uses WebAssembly (WASM) and has specific requirements:

### Critical Implementation Patterns

1. **Environment Variable Access** (`internal/env/`):
   - Regular Go: Uses `os.Getenv()`
   - Workers: Uses `cloudflare.Getenv()` from syumai/workers
   - Always use the `internal/env` package for environment variables to ensure cross-platform compatibility

2. **HTTP Client Requirements** (`internal/server/client*.go`):
   - Regular Go: Uses standard `http.Client`
   - Workers: Must use `fetch.Client` from syumai/workers to avoid "Illegal invocation" errors
   - The server defines an `HTTPClient` interface to abstract platform differences
   - Platform-specific implementations are selected via build tags

### Build Tags

Files specific to Cloudflare Workers use the build tags:
```go
//go:build js && wasm
```

Files for regular environments use:
```go
//go:build !js || !wasm
```

### Project Structure for Workers

- `cmd/claude-code-proxy-worker/`: Workers-specific entry point
- `internal/app/`: Shared application logic between regular and Workers builds
- Platform-specific files use `_workers.go` suffix for Workers implementations
